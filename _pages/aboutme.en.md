      <p>
        My academic journey began with curiosity and exploration of the unknown. From initially seeking rigorous data logic in the engineering field to now deeply cultivating the social pulse of the digital era within the realm of communication, this interdisciplinary journey has served as a bridge, connecting my intrinsic pursuit of technical rationality with a deep concern for humanistic warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that within the deluge of data, we can touch upon the most authentic human experiences and emotional connections, and at this intersection, I am dedicated to exploring, from a unique perspective, how digital technology profoundly influences and shapes our social lives.

    <p>My research explores several interconnected areas, driven by an interest in understanding human experience and social dynamics in digital contexts:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight-text">Computational Communication</span>: Applying computational methods to understand communication patterns in digital environments.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight-text">Digital Emotional Expression</span>: Exploring how individuals express and process emotions in online spaces.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight-text">Digital Mourning</span>: Investigating the practices and communities that form around grief and remembrance in virtual environments.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight-text">Online Communities</span>: Analyzing the formation, dynamics, and impact of digital communities on individual identity and collective experience.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight-text">Women's Issues</span>: Focusing on women's expression, identity construction, empowerment, and related gender issues in digital environments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I approach these topics from an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating computational analysis with deep qualitative methods to uncover nuanced insights into group dynamics and shared emotional landscapes within these domains.</p>

## Abstract

This presentation explores the dynamics of emotional resonance within digital communities, examining how shared emotional experiences contribute to community formation and maintenance in online spaces. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that combines computational text analysis with in-depth qualitative interviews, the research identifies patterns of emotional expression that serve as binding mechanisms in digital communities focused on shared interests, experiences, or identities.

The findings suggest that emotional resonance in digital spaces operates through multiple mechanisms: linguistic mirroring, narrative reinforcement, and collective meaning-making. Platform affordances play a crucial role in either facilitating or constraining these processes, highlighting the socio-technical nature of digital emotional expression.

This research contributes to our understanding of how emotional connections are formed and maintained in an increasingly digitized social landscape, offering insights into the human dimension of technological engagement.

## Project Overview

This research project investigates the emergence and evolution of digital mourning practices on social media platforms. By examining how individuals express grief, commemorate the deceased, and form support networks in online spaces, this project aims to understand the intersection of digital technology and human emotional experiences.

### Research Questions

1. How do individuals express and process grief in digital environments?
2. What forms of commemoration emerge in social media spaces, and how do they differ from traditional mourning practices?
3. How do online communities form around shared experiences of loss?
4. What roles do platform affordances play in shaping digital mourning practices?

### Methodology

This project employs a mixed-methods approach, combining:

- Computational text analysis of memorial posts
- Digital ethnography of online memorial communities
- In-depth interviews with participants in digital mourning spaces
- Analysis of platform features and their influence on mourning practices

## Current Status / Key Insights

This research is currently in the data collection phase. Preliminary analysis suggests several emerging themes:

- The personalization of digital memorial spaces
- Temporal patterns in community engagement with digital memorials
- The role of algorithms in shaping visibility and longevity of memorial content
- Tensions between public and private expressions of grief

Future work will focus on deeper analysis of the collected data and developing a theoretical framework for understanding digital mourning in the context of broader shifts in emotional expression online.

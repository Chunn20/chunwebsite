Hello and welcome to my personal academic website and its accompanying blog! I'm thrilled to open this space as a complement to my more formal research pages.

While my research delves into the fascinating intersection of computational communication, qualitative methods, and humanistic inquiry – uncovering nuanced insights into group dynamics and shared emotional landscapes within digital social phenomena – this blog will be a more informal arena. Here, I plan to share reflections on ongoing projects, offer deeper dives into specific methodologies, discuss emerging trends in our field, and perhaps even share a glimpse into the academic journey itself.

My hope is for this blog to be a place for curiosity, exploration, and thoughtful discussion. It's an opportunity to connect beyond published papers, to share evolving ideas, and to engage with the broader academic community and anyone interested in the humanistic side of digital studies.

Thank you for visiting. I look forward to the conversations and insights we can share here.

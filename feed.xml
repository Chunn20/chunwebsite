My research is rooted in computational communication, integrating in-depth qualitative methods.  I aim to transcend traditional quantitative paradigms, gaining micro-level insights into individual experiences  and emotional trajectories, to understand the complexity and resonance of human nature within social media emotion,  digital mourning, and online communities from a humanistic perspective. Feel free to explore my site to learn more  about my academic journey, and I look forward to connecting with you.

I’m thrilled to open this space as a complement to my more formal research pages.</p>

<p>While my research delves into the fascinating intersection of computational communication, qualitative methods, and humanistic inquiry – uncovering nuanced insights into group dynamics and shared emotional landscapes within digital social phenomena – this blog will be a more informal arena. Here, I plan to share reflections on ongoing projects, offer deeper dives into specific methodologies, discuss emerging trends in our field, and perhaps even share a glimpse into the academic journey itself.</p>

<p>My hope is for this blog to be a place for curiosity, exploration, and thoughtful discussion. It’s an opportunity to connect beyond published papers, to share evolving ideas, and to engage with the broader academic community and anyone interested in the humanistic side of digital studies.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting. I look forward to the conversations and insights we can share here.</p>]]></content><author><name>Xinchun Li</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="academic" /><category term="introduction" /><category term="digital research" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to my personal academic website and its accompanying blog!

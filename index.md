Welcome! My research is rooted in computational communication, integrating in-depth qualitative methods. I aim to transcend traditional quantitative paradigms, gaining nuanced insights into group dynamics and shared emotional landscapes, to understand the complexity and resonance of human nature within social media emotion, digital mourning, and online communities from a humanistic perspective. 

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my academic journey, and I look forward to connecting with you.
